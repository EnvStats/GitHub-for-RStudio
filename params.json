{"name":"GitHub-for-RStudio","tagline":"Designed to help scientists setup version control in RStudio with minimal confusion","body":"### Welcome to the GitHub for RStudio Group Collaboration Setup Pages.\r\n----------\r\n### This site is a reference for setting up GitHub for a group to work with R projects in RStudio. The three steps outlined below are designed to setup a fork from a main project directory in GitHub so that multiple people can collaborate on a project. The assumption is that you have already setup a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, and installed both [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) on your machine.\r\n\r\n**Setup instructions:**\r\n\r\n1 **Download Git for your operating system ([link](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads)):**  This program allows R to interface with GitHub. **After installing Git:** *In RStudio select Tools, then Global options, then Git/SVN.  Enable version control for RStudio, then browse to your directory that has git.exe. Select OK, then restart R.*  \r\n\r\n**2 After you open a GitHub account, navigate to the repository that is setup for your group, click on the \"Fork\" icon at the top of GitHub page.**  This creates a copy (clone) of the master project directory that is now your repository **(repository = Project in R).**  *Copy the HTTPS clone URL from the box next to your repository on the right. Check the link, it should have your GitHub user name in it.*\r\n\r\n3 **In RStudio, select new project, then version control, then Git.**  Here is where you will paste the link from the GitHub clone (step 2 above). *Click Tab key and R will create a project name from the one used in GitHub.*\r\n**Finishing step 3 will automaticly copy all files into your new R directory on your PC.**  These are all the files currently in the main GitHub directory that you forked, so you dont have to start from scratch.  \r\n\r\nMore detailed description for setting up GitHub with RStudio from Ecologist ([link](http://www.molecularecologist.com/2013/11/using-github-with-r-and-rstudio/)), and \r\nRstudio ([link](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)).\r\n\r\n--------\r\n**Update Your Forked Directory With Upstream Main Project** ([link](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/)).\r\n\r\nIn GitHub, copy the link from the main project directory (*Do not copy the link from your forked directory*).  In RStudio, select Tools, then Shell. At the Shell command prompt type:\r\n\r\n`> git pull https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git BRANCH_NAME`  \r\n\r\nIf there are no conflicts, this will update all files in your main PC directory with the main project on GitHub.  Push these changes to your Forked GitHub Repo using the R Push option.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGitHub user @Bern67 generated this page. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
